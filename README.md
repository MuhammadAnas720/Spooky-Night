# Spooky-Night


# Project Name: 
Spooky Night

# Project Description: 
The project is an Animate on Scroll webpage that uses a comic as its storyline. The project is an unique user interactive comic that takes the user over a set of funny inter-linked riddles, which are both directed at the user, and become part of a conversation between two main characters on the screen. Hence, it's a lighter note conversation of two characers, where one messes up with the other by trying to trick them. While this helps build the narrative and setting, the main element or idea is to strike these riddles at the user, whilst not making them stressed about it either. 

In all this process, we use web as a medium of storytelling itself. Rather than "putting" our comic on the web, we used it as an experience and instrument of story telling itself. The comic progresses with each scroll, and to further into the story, you have to scroll to see what follows. All this scroll is for the exciting animation that follows in the storyline, where each elements occurs in its time and space, depending on how far user has reached. By an animated webpage, riddles directed at the user, engaging comedy, and other effects, we have made the experience interactive and immersive for the user.

To further elevate the project, we have designed it in a Halloween theme, which encompasses both the storyline and web experience of the project. For this, we have carefully applied designed elements, such as user of color themes and palettes, specific fonts, animations, etc, that make this experience come alive.


# Process: 
The process was a gradual and natural process. The first aspect was brainstorming, where 4 of the team members got together, and brainstormed any ideas they could think of, for the storyline. After a list of ideas, the one for interlinked riddles was decided upon. However, it seemed to lack the element of a narrative, coupled with the fact that we didn't want to stress the user up with a set of unanswerable riddles. To fix this, we thought of the idea of having it as a conversation between two ghosts, who use their "knowledge of the humanly world" to test the other. 

The idea then followed by implementation. We dividied up in two teams - Comic Design (Alpha and Hessa) and Web Development (Shreya and me). The first team started first with mkaing illustrations, sketches and other graphics, which set the basis of our comic. Special attention was given to consistency, appeal and color tone. This is evident through how all the backgrounds in the comic follow an illustrative design, while the characters, both in riddles and the ghosts have "sketcy appearance" The color theme for these characters on most parts follows a Halloween color them as well.

When it came to web, as said before, we wanted to exploit as a a medium of storytelling itself. For this, we made use of animations, effects, and designs to porivde an immersive experience. The Skrollr Javascript library came in to be very handy for this purpose. It helped us set the exact scroll data points at which the particular animation would occur. In total, we set and defined about 140,000 pixel data values to their corressponding actions. This was the biggest challenge, as to account for each and every one of these pixel changes, and then incorporating all of them together to provide a seamless user experience. A significant effort was also put into making the website look appealing to the user, which was done through color themes, font selection, and layout of all the pages. These further helped us not just display the story or conversation, but incorporate it with the web technical details.

# Reflection/Evaluation: 
The project was a unique experience of incorporating comic storyline or plot throught the medium of web. As a group, we felt very satisfied with what we accomplished. The fact that we started with extensive planning, helped us be clear with our expectations and what we eventually whanted to accomplish. The process was challenging, required lots of implementation ideas, some trial and error, and effort to learn and adapt to new technicalities, such as skrollr library. However, it surely was rewarding, both in terms of the final product, and the learning it provided to us as a team.
